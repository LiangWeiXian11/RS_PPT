## Part 1: **Summary** {.center}
• The **summary** criterion will refer to the summary of the sensor you have selected -- **Landset**

## summary

##### Landsat imagery {auto-animate="true"}
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
> Landsat imagery is the longest free temporal image repository of consistent medium resolution data. It collects data at each point on Earth each every **16 days** (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of **30 by 30 m cells** (spatial resolution). Geographical analysis and concepts are becoming ever more entwined with remote sensing and Earth observation.

## What is general application of **Landset 8**?

**Overall**

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
Landsat 8, launched in 2013, is a pivotal Earth-observing satellite widely utilized for applications such as monitoring land use changes, assessing environmental impact, managing agriculture by monitoring crop health and yields, tracking water resources, evaluating forestry conditions, aiding urban planning, contributing to climate studies, supporting disaster response with high-resolution imagery, facilitating scientific research across various disciplines, and serving as a crucial tool in mapping and cartography for detailed and up-to-date geographic information.

The continuous acquisition of data by Landsat 8, along with its moderate spatial resolution (30 meters for most bands), spectral capabilities, and global coverage, makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications in Earth observation and remote sensing.

## Limitation {.center}

### Part 3: reflection {.center}
-   Despite some limitations, Landsat 8 remains a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, contributing significantly to our understanding of Earth's dynamics and changes over time.

## **Limitations:**

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
1.  **Spatial Resolution:** While Landsat 8 provides valuable data, its spatial resolution (30 meters for most bands) may not be sufficient for certain applications requiring very high detail, such as urban planning at a local scale.

2.  **Temporal Resolution:** Landsat 8 has a revisit time of 16 days, which means it may not capture events or changes on a daily or weekly basis. For some applications, more frequent revisit times are necessary.

3.  **Limited Spectral Bands:** Landsat 8 has fewer spectral bands compared to some other remote sensing satellites, which limits its ability to capture certain types of information, especially in the infrared and shortwave infrared regions.

4.  **Cloud Cover:** Cloud cover can hinder the acquisition of clear imagery, impacting the availability of data for certain regions and time periods.

5.  **Data Processing:** Analyzing Landsat data requires specialized software and expertise, and the large volume of data can pose challenges for storage and processing.
