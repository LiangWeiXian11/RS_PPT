It collects data at each point on Earth each every 16 days (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of 30 by 30 m cells (spatial resolution). Geographical analysis and concepts are becoming ever more entwined with remote sensing and Earth observation.\n\n\nSource: CASA0023\n\nAccess the data\n\nTo access the Landsat data we will use in this practical you can need to sign up for a free account at: https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/\n\n\nSource: usgs"

For some applications, more frequent revisit times are necessary.\nLimited Spectral Bands: Landsat 8 has fewer spectral bands compared to some other remote sensing satellites, which limits its ability to capture certain types of information, especially in the infrared and shortwave infrared regions."
