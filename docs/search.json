For some applications, more frequent revisit times are necessary.\nLimited Spectral Bands: Landsat 8 has fewer spectral bands compared to some other remote sensing satellites, which limits its ability to capture certain types of information, especially in the infrared and shortwave infrared regions.\nCloud Cover: Cloud cover can hinder the acquisition of clear imagery, impacting the availability of data for certain regions and time periods.\nData Processing: Analyzing Landsat data requires specialized software and expertise, and the large volume of data can pose challenges for storage and processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2: PPT • LWX"
